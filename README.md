# Machine Vision          

## Information

A template of standard algorithms for machine vision (in Matlab) simple to understand and easy to use for ND quality control. 


## Algorithms

* [ErosionDilation](https://github.com/skalaouzis/MachineVision/blob/master/ErosionDilation.m): is the algorithm of Removing noise, Isolation of individual elements and joining disparate elements in an image, Finding of intensity bumps or holes in an image.

* [Kmeans.m	Create Kmeans](https://github.com/skalaouzis/MachineVision/blob/master/Kmeans.m): k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

* [Odometry(StereoVision)](https://github.com/skalaouzis/MachineVision/blob/master/Odometry(StereoVision).m): visual odometry is the process of determining the position and orientation of a robot by analyzing the associated camera images.
